# PDF AI Assistant Server

Overview:
A web app that allows users to upload PDFs and interact with them via AI-powered chat. The app extracts text from PDFs, generates embeddings, and uses vector search to provide context-aware answers. Page locations of relevant content are highlighted in the PDF viewer.

## How it Works:

- User signs up and logs in.

- PDFs are uploaded to the backend, saved to Supabase, and embeddings are generated.

- Chat queries are sent to the backend; vector search retrieves relevant context, which is sent to the AI chat as prompt context.

- Fuse.js is used for precise text matching to highlight exact locations in PDFs.

## Challenges Solved:

- PDF highlight registration (solved using Fuse.js for efficient text matching)

- Backend AI integration with vector search

- Multi-PDF management with chat context persistence
